## Football

This repo is for exploring the football results dataset available from 

| http://api.football-data.org/code_samples |
|---|

This repo assumes an install / working directory at

```
~/PycharmProjects/football
```

with an file containing an authentication token [available here](http://api.football-data.org/register) as a single line of text, kept at the following location:

```
~/PycharmProjects/football/football/auth_token.txt
```

Eventually this will be deprecated and replaced by a football module api which the auth token can be passed to instead.

In a terminal, do
```
 $ grip ~/PycharmProjects/football/football/table.md
```

And open a browser at [http://localhost:6419](http://localhost:6419)

### Grip
